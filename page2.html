		<h1>Connect it toÂ your broadband</h1>
		<p>Your Sky+HD box needs to be connected to the internet and once it is you'll also have access to a huge library of TV and movies on demand. There are two ways of setting this connection up:</p>

		<header>
			<div class="image-wrapper">
				<img src="images/tab2iconwireless.png" width="70" alt="Wireless" class="icon">
			</div>
			<h2>Wireless connection</h2>
			<p>This is recommended if your Sky+HD box and broadband router are in different rooms or if you prefer less clutter.</p>
		</header>
		
		<p>To get started you'll need the Wireless Connector, which you can buy from our accessories website. Then follow the step by step guide in the packaging to connect your Sky+HD box to your broadband network wirelessly.</p>

			<div class="image-wrapper">
				<img src="images/tab2iconwired.png" width="80" height="80" alt="Wired" class="icon">
			</div>
			<h2>Wired connection</h2>
			<p>This is recommended if your Sky+HD box and broadband router are close together.</p>
		</header>

		<p>To get started you'll need an Ethernet cable, push one end of the cable into a spare Ethernet port on your broadband router and the other end into the Ethernet port on the back of your Sky+HD box. Once this is done you'll see a message on your TV instructing you to press select on your Sky remote control and follow the on screen instructions.</p>
