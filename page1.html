		<h1>A Sky+HD box with the new Sky Guide</h1>
		<p>We're updating the Sky Guide on the majority of our Sky+HD boxes to make it easier to use. We've improved the way the Sky Guide looks and you'll be able to find your favourite shows more quickly. You do not need an HD pack to access the new Sky Guide. The first phase of update is now complete and all DRX890 models of the Sky+HD and the Sky+HD 1TB should now have the new Sky Guide.</p>
		<img src="images/Tab1Tvimage.png" width="200" height="146" alt="Sky products" class="sky-products">
		<p>To find out which Sky+HD box model you have, press Services on your Sky Remote, then press 0 to highlight Settings. Press 3 to highlight System Details. Note down the version number, 2nd line from the top of the screen:</p>
		<ul class="list1">
			<li><h3>4F31</h3> You have an Amstrad DRX890 or DRX895 and you should already have the new Sky Guide</li>
			<li><h3>4F30</h3> You have an Amstrad DRX780. You'll receive the new Sky Guide in the next few months</li>
			<li><h3>9730</h3> You have a Samsung. You'll receive the new Sky Guide in the next few months</li>
			<li><h3>9F30</h3> You have a Pace. You'll receive the new Sky Guide in the next few months</li>
			<li><h3>4E30</h3> You have a Thomson. Unfortunately, we are not updating this box with the new Sky Guide.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The new Sky Guide is only available on certain boxes as only Sky+HD boxes have the power and capabilities to run the new software. Thomson and older Sky+ are not optimised for software updates or services such as these enhanced Sky+ app features and our library of TV on demand.</p>
