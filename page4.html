	<h1>Help &gt; How to use</h1>

	<p>Connect your iPhone to the same Wi-Fi network as your Sky+HD box, and the app will search for any compatible Sky+HD boxes on the network. Once the Sky+ app has found one, it&apos;ll connect and you&apos;re good to go.</p>

	<h2>Navigation bar</h2>
	<p>If you tap the Sky logo at the top of the Sky+ app for iPad, a navigation bar will appear and you&apos;ll be able to access the different sections of the app. The Planner section will only work when your iPad is connected to your Sky+HD box via your wifi network.</p>

	<h2>TV Guide</h2>
	<p>In the TV Guide on the Sky+ app for iPhone, you can find out what&apos;s on over the next seven days. You&apos;ll also be able to sort programmes by genre, easily find the schedule for a chosen day, and press a channel logo to watch that channel on your TV.</p>

	<h2>Programme detail guide</h2>
	<p>Once you&apos;ve found the programme you are looking for, you&apos;ll see the summary of that programme and the option to either Record or Remind. If the show is being broadcast at that time, you&apos;ll also be able to press watch and the programme will start playing on your TV.</p>

	<h2>Using your iPhone as a remote control</h2>
	<p>To use your iPhone as a remote control using the Sky+ app, tap the small circular icon in the top right hand corner of the screen. To find out the correct finger movements to operate the iPhone for use as a remote control, select Show Gesture Guide and the instructions will appear.</p>

	<h2>The Planner</h2>
	<p>Here you&apos;ll see all the recordings you have in your Planner, as well as the future recordings and reminders you have set. Just tap on a tab to sort your planner by that genre and tap it again to change the date order.</p>

	<p>Once you&apos;ve found a programme you want, tap on it and the Planner detail page will appear giving you the option to start playing it on your TV.</p>

	<h2>Settings</h2>
	<p>In the Sky+HD box connectivity section of the Sky+ app for iPhone, you&apos;ll be able to choose which box to connect to (as long as it&apos;s also got the new Sky Guide and it&apos;s connected to the same broadband network).</p>

	<p>You can also turn off the new features and stop the app connecting to the Sky+HD box.</p>
